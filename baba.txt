We are attempting to solve levels of the game Baba Is You from base principles by creating testable axiomatic insights.

Start by drawing the map, then attempt to make hypotheses about subsequent rules of the game and reachable states based on your observations so far.
All rules listed so far have been confirmed by the game's mechanics and are considered true.  Please point out any that might be in error.
For any proposed new rules, include a test of how you would confirm or deny the rule in the game in the current level.

No NOT propose rules using any new objects/mechanics/syntax not already introduced below.  Rules should primarily be 2nd-order implications from the existing rules.
Where a syntax clarification or extension is needed, propose it as a new rule and test which can validate it in the current level.

Please start by drawing the current map from these observations, using ASCII art or a simple diagram.

# ========================================

We are playing a grid-based text game called Baba Is You.  The game consists of a grid of objects, each with its own properties and rules.  The goal is to manipulate the objects and rules to reach a win condition.

The current level can be defined as follows:
```
state = [
    ("WALL", 11, 3),
    ("IS  ", 12, 3),
    ("STOP", 13, 3),
    ("ROCK", 19, 3),
    ("IS  ", 20, 3),
    ("PUSH", 21, 3),
    ("BABA", 11, 11),
    ("IS  ", 12, 11),
    ("YOU ", 13, 11),
    ("FLAG", 19, 11),
    ("IS  ", 20, 11),
    ("WIN ", 21, 11),
    ("baba", 12, 7),
    ("rock", 16, 6),
    ("rock", 16, 7),
    ("rock", 16, 8),
    ("flag", 20, 7),
    ("wall", 11, 5),
    ("wall", 12, 5),
    ("wall", 13, 5),
    ("wall", 14, 5),
    ("wall", 15, 5),
    ("wall", 16, 5),
    ("wall", 17, 5),
    ("wall", 18, 5),
    ("wall", 19, 5),
    ("wall", 20, 5),
    ("wall", 21, 5),
    ("wall", 11, 9),
    ("wall", 12, 9),
    ("wall", 13, 9),
    ("wall", 14, 9),
    ("wall", 15, 9),
    ("wall", 16, 9),
    ("wall", 17, 9),
    ("wall", 18, 9),
    ("wall", 19, 9),
    ("wall", 20, 9),
    ("wall", 21, 9),
]
```

There are distinct differences between upper and lower case objects, but otherwise matching objects are identical.
We observe the ability to move the "baba" object U, D, L, or R with the arrow keys. Pressing space performs a WAIT (W) move that does nothing.
Coordinates of "baba" are affected accordingly: U: (x,y+1), D: (x,y-1), L: (x-1,y), R: (x+1,y). 
The "baba" object can interact with other objects based on the rules defined in the level.
The rules so far (visible in the pause screen) are:
- baba is you
- wall is stop
- flag is win
- rock is push
We believe these are caused by adjacent objects BABA IS YOU, WALL IS STOP, FLAG IS WIN, and ROCK IS PUSH.

We are hoping to deduce additional rules based on the current level setup.  Please provide any insights you have on the current state of the level and any potential rules that can be inferred from it.
All suggested rules must be TESTABLE.  i.e. you must provide a set of moves and an expected state they will reach which validates the hypothesis.

Please provide additional action rules in the json format:
```
{
  'RULE': <your action rule short name here>
  'DESCRIPTION': <your action rule description here>
  'MOVES': <short list of previously-defined actions to apply to test the rule, e.g. ['U', 'R', 'R']>,
  'ACTION': (state, moves) => <function transforming to new expected state after the action>,
  'TESTS': {
    '<test_name>' : {
      'DESCRIPTION': <test description>,
      'STATE': <state before the action>,
      'EXPECTED_STATE': <state after the action>,
    },
  },
}
```

Example rules:
```
{
  'RULE': 'baba_UP_2',
  'DESCRIPTION': 'Move baba up twice, failing if blocked', 
  'MOVES': ['U', 'U'],
  'ACTION': (state, moves) => ,


Aim for short testable sequences that can confirm or deny the rule.  Pursue rules that are likely to lead to a win condition.
